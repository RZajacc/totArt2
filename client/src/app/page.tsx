          So to begin with what where does this name comes from? Well It comes
          from a name of a simple psychological phenomenon when you try to
          recall something and you feel like you almost have it but not really.
          It is called a tip of the tongue phenomenon.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It applies for words and informations, but here I will use it in a
          different context. How many times have you walked around the city,
          seen a cool place and thoght "cool, I should definitely remember this
          place", and the next they you forget that it ever existed?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          If this feeling is familiar to you&apos;ve came to the right place.
          You can document those places here or just watch, what other people
          shared! Hope you&apos;ll enjoy it! Tp start browsing the content just
