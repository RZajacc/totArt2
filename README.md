# Totart

### Version information:

Previous version of the project that you might find in my repository differs significantly from this one. Starting with being built with React + Vite, and styled Bootstrap. I kept it just as reminder of the work I did before, to appreciate the the progress I've made, but nevertheles this version of the project is considered as main one. If you would still like to take a look at previous version you'll find it [here](https://github.com/RZajacc/totArt).

### Description:

Project is made for users the users to share some interesting locations around Berlin. It is not about the fancy places that everyone knows, quite the contrary, more about small things that draws our attention and we find cool. Small things that get forgotten few minutes after they are being seen but we think desire some attention. The name refers to the tip of The Tongue phenomenon, where a person fails to retrieve some word or term from memory, combined with partial recall and feeling that retrieval is imminent. Here it refers to those places and this app aims to adress this issue and keep the memory alive.
