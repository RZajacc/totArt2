# Totart

### Version information:

This is the most recent version of the project built with **MERN** stack. It is currently being refactored. Most of the functionality is taken directly from previous version that you might find [here](https://github.com/RZajacc/totArt). But due to migrating from Vite React app to Next.js with app router, not all functionalities are currently applied.

- **Client** side of the application is built with React and Next.js, Typescript, and TailwindCSS. For data fetching I'm using SWR library.
- **Server** side is built with Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB.

**Currently working on**:

- Adding new locations
- User dashboard
- Error and Loading pages
- Responsiveness - app is built mobile first, currently its not styled for desktop
- Email confirmation link
- Resetting forgotten password
- Introducing Typescript to server side of the app

**_Some of those functionalities are working in the previous version linked before._**

### Description:

Project is made for users the users to share some interesting locations around Berlin. It is not about the fancy places that everyone knows, quite the contrary, more about small things that draws our attention and we find cool. Small things that get forgotten few minutes after they are being seen but we think desire some attention. The name refers to the tip of The Tongue phenomenon, where a person fails to retrieve some word or term from memory, combined with partial recall and feeling that retrieval is imminent. Here it refers to those places and this app aims to adress this issue and keep the memory alive.
Before you start using the application check README files in corresponding sections of the app (client and server).

> [!NOTE]
> Main goal of the project is to learn, so any tips are welcome!
